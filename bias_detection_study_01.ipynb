    "The purpose of this study is to create a detector of biased (non-random) ship placement which can be used to adjust shooting player strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until this point, all scripts have been assuming ideally random placement of ships on the board. However, in realworld scenarios, each player will have his own playstyle or subconscious preferences on how he distributes the ships. If the shooting player is able to decrypt this bias, or at least slightly adjust the probabilities of scoring hits in certain fields based on history of games played against the same adversary, he should be able to decrease the average amount of moves needed to win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the vast amount of possible game setups in standard, 10x10 board filled with 7 ships, for this study I decided to go easier route and reduced it to 6x6 board with 1x seg3 ship and 2x seg2 ships. The scripts which have prevously hardcoded values as for 10x10 board, were now made parametric. Hopedully, the solutions that I develop and test here with this easier setup, could be upscaled in future. \n",
    "\n",
    "In bias detector I will be creating a bunch of metrics describing the board setup (distance of ships to egdes, their clustering etc.)\n",
    "These metrics will be calculated for each board setup in a set of randomly generated boards. Mean values and confidence intervals will be determined.\n",
    "Then, same will be applied for another set of board setups, generated with some bias. For each metric, the detector will check if confidence interval determined from random boards overlaps the one determined from possibly biased boards. This way it can find statisticallty relevant bias."
